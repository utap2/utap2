UTAP: User-friendly Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline
===================================================

RNA-Seq technology is routinely used to characterize the transcriptome and detect gene expression differences among cell types, genotypes and conditions. Advances in short-read sequencing instruments such as Illumina Next-Seq, have yielded easy-to-operate machines, with higher throughput, at a lower price per base. However, processing this data requires bioinformatics expertise to tailor and execute specific solutions for each type of library preparation.

In order to enable fast and user-friendly data analysis, we developed an intuitive and scalable transcriptome pipeline that executes the full process, starting from sequences (RNA-Seq and bulk MARS-Seq), and ending with sets of differentially expressed genes. Output files are placed in a structured folder system, and summarization of the results is displayed in a rich and comprehensive report containing dozens of plots, tables and links.
