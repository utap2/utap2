Analysis pipeline steps
-----------------------

The steps performed by the pipeline -

1. Trim adapter sequences

2. Fastqc for quality control of the samples will be run in parallel to the steps described

3. Map reads to the selected reference genome

4. Add UMI and gene information to the reads

5. Quantify gene expression by counting reads

6. Count UMI's for cases of PCR bias

7. Detect Deferentially Expressed (DE) genes for a model with a single factor

Steps 3 and 5 are performed only for Mars-Seq

Steps 6 is performed only if DESeq2 is selected

Pipeline report
---------------

Upon completion you will get an email with links to the results report

The report includes several sections -

1. Sequencing and Mapping QC

    a. **Figure 1** - Plots the average quality of each base across all reads. Quality of 30 (predicted error rate 1:1000) and up is good

    b. **Figure 2** - Histogram showing the number of reads for each sample in raw data
    c. **Figure 3** - Histogram showing the percent of reads discarded after trimming the adapters (after the removing of the adapters some read and polyA/T or low quality reads may be too short and the pipeline discards them)
    d. **Figure 4** - Histogram with the number of reads for each sample in each step of the pipeline
    e. **Figure 5** - Plots sequence coverage on and near gene regions
    f. **Figure 6** -
        i.  Histogram showing the percent of reads that mapped uniquely and not uniquely per sample
        ii. Histogram showing the percent of the uniquely mapped reads that mapped to genes (genes included must have at least 5 reads)
2. Exploratory Analysis
    a. **Figure 7** - Heatmap plotting the highly-expressed genes (above 5% of total expression). For example the expression of gene RN45S in sample SRR3112243 amounts to 15% of the expression
    b. **Figure 8** - Heatmap of Pearson correlation between samples according to the gene expression values
    c. **Figure 9** - Clustering dendogram of the samples according to the gene expression
    d. **Figure 10** - PCA analysis
        i. Histogram of % explained variability for each PC component
        ii. PCA plot of PC1 vs PC2 c. PCA plot of PC1 vs PC3

3. Differential Expression Analysis (this section exists only if you run the DESeq2 analysis) - a table with the number of differential expressed genes (DE) in each category (up/down) for the different contrasts.  In addition, links for p-value distribution, volcano plots and heatmaps as well as a table of the DE genes with dot plots of their expression values

4. Bioinformatics Pipeline Methods - description of pipeline methods utilized

5. Links to additional results - links for downloading tables with raw, normalized counts, log normalized values (rld) and statistical data of contrasts. In case of model with batches, "combat" values were calculated (instead of rld) using "sva" package and are batch corrected normalized log2 count values.


Annotation file
---------------

For the counts of the reads per gene we use with annotation files (gtf format) from "ensemble" or "gencode". In MARS-seq analysis we extend the 3' UTR exon away from the transcript on the DNA and extend or cut the 3" UTR exon towards the 5' direction on the mRNA.
